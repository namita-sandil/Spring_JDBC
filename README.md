# Spring_JDBC
It contains Programs that represent the basics operations like insert , update delete and select from database using Spring JDBC XML Configuration.
Down this project and open it in your eclips IDE , Its a Maven project which contains all depenedency so you dont need to add it manually.
For the Configuration I have used XML Based Configuration make sure you make changes regarding your own database connectivity settings,
I have used MySQL8 Database connectivity here.
And then u can simply run this project.
